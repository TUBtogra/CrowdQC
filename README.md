# CrowdQC
This package performs a quality control (QC) and filters suspicious data from citizen weather stations (CWS). 
It was designed for hourly air temperature data from Netatmo stations but should work with any normally-distributed data. 

An evaluation and detailed explanation of the applied filters can be found at https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00118/full
